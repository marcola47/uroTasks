# MERN Task Manager 

## Instructions
1. Open 2 terminals, one on the client folder and the other on the server folder
2. `npm install` -> install dependencies on both client and server folders

Server commands:
`npm run dev` -> start nodemon server.

Client commands:
`npm start` -> run React project;
`npm build` -> build the project for production.

## What is it?
* Basically a  slightly dumbed down Trello clone. 

## Observations:
* For now, I'm only doing the front-end and making it function properly, when I'm satisfied, I'll start working on the back-end.

* By no means this is professional sofware, only for practicing purposes, as there are much better software for this out there.

* This is basically my first 'big' project using React and Node, the others I made were simple lists and the classic calculator. So, I guess there is a lot to learn from this, especially considering this is my first real tackle at full stack development.
